# EcommerceAPI 
## Project summary: This capstone is an e-commerce application, or an online store. The website uses a Spring Boot API project for the backend server, with a 
MySQL database for data storage.

### Phase 1: 

During phase 1, I was tasked to impliment the logic for the prebuilt category controller class as well as to add annotations to the controller.
I had to: 

-Get all categories

-Get category by ID

-Get all products from a specific category

-Post create new category for admin access only

-Put update exsisting category for admin access only

-Delete remove category for admin access only

### Phase 2:

During phase 2 I was tasked with fixing 2 bug in the code that was provided to us. For the first bug, I had to fix incorrect product search results when filtering the by price range, the SQL query had the max price missing causing some problems with the filtering.
For the second bug, I fixed an issue when an admin went to update a product, the product would be created added over again instead of being updated.
